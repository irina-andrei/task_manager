# task_manager
A program for a small business that can help it to manage tasks assigned to each member of the team, each member being able to login, access tasks and modify them. 
This program will work with two text files, user.txt and tasks.txt. 
The program allows the admin to: 

        ♦ Register user
        ♦ Assign task
        ♦ View all tasks
        ♦ View current user tasks
        ♦ Generate reports
        ♦ Display statistics

If a user doesn't have admin privileges, they won't be able to generate reports or display statistics.
